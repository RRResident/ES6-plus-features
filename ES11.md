# ECMAScript 2020 (ES11)

## String.prototype.matchAll()

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/matchAll)

The `matchAll()` method returns an iterator of all the results matched against a string. It was possible to iterate through multiple matches prior to this, but this has been made much easier.

```javascript
const regex = /l/g;
const str = 'Hello, World!';

const result = [...str.matchAll(regex)];
for (let i of result) {
    console.log(i); // ["l"], ["l"], ["l"]
}
```

## Bigint

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/BigInt)

Before ES10, the biggest number supported in JavaScript was `9007199254740991`. Now with support for the new primative `bigint`, 2⁵³ and above numbers are supported. There is no upper limit as per the spec for `bigint`, I've tried pushing the limit in browser JS engines and eventually get an error `RangeError: Maximum BigInt size exceeded`, therefore it seems it relies on the implementing engine or the available memory to determine a maximum.
Declaring a `bigint` is done by adding an `n` to the end of a number.

```javascript
const a = 1n;
typeof a; // "bigint"
```

You cannot mix `number` and `bigint`

```javascript
1n + 1;
// TypeError: Cannot mix BigInt and other types, use explicit conversions
```

However you can convert to a `number`, as long as it is within the range of `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` and `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`

```javascript
Number(1n) + 1;
// 2
```

## Dynamic import !!!

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)

This is a new function-like import which can support asynchonous loading of modules, you also don't have to use string literals like the normal `import` statement, and can use template literals, like so:

```javascript
import(`./pathToSomeFile/${file}.js`);
```

An example of its use could be loading in a module when a user clicks a button, this example is from MDN docs, linked above

```javascript
const main = document.querySelector('main');
for (const link of document.querySelectorAll('nav > a')) {
    link.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();

        import('/modules/my-module.js')
            .then((module) => {
                module.loadPageInto(main);
            })
            .catch((err) => {
                main.textContent = err.message;
            });
    });
}
```

`import()` returns a promise, in the example above we're using `then()` stynax to load the resolved promise into the page, or catch an error and inject that into the page.

You can also assign these dynamic imports to variables. Say we want to load in a module when a button is clicked, and use a function from that module, we could do the following:

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', async () => {
    // await our module, which is the resolved promise from the dynamic import
    const module = await import('./path/to/module.js');
    module.buttonClick(); // then call function from the import
});
```

## Promise.allSettled()

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled)

`Promise.allSettled()` returns a promise, when _all_ of the passed promises are either fulfilled or rejected. The returned promise is an array of objects that describe each of the outcomes of the passed promises.

```javascript
const prom1 = Promise.resolve(1); // Create a promise that resolves

const prom2 = new Promise((res, rej) => rej()); // and one that rejects

// Pass them inside an iterable to Promise.allSettled()
Promise.allSettled([prom1, prom2]).then((results) => {
    results.forEach((result) => {
        console.log(result.status); // Log the status of each one
    });
});

// fulfilled
// rejected
```

## globalThis()

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis)

The `globalThis` property came about as a need for a standard way to refer to the global `this` object. Between the web, Node and Web workers, there isn't a one-way-fits-all to do this, for example `global` works for Node, but `window` will work on the web, and only `this` can work for web workers.
This gives a standard, across-the-board way to access the global `this` object.

## import.meta

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import.meta)

`import.meta` serves as an object that contains context-specific information about the current module, such as it's URL. The object is extensible and writable, and can only be accessed inside a module.

## Nullish coalescing !!!

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator)

In essence, the nullish coalescing operator will return its right side when the left side is `null` or `undefined`. Other values (even ones that are 'falsy' like `''` or `0`) will be returned

```javascript
const foo = null ?? 'bar'; // foo: 'bar'
const country = 'England' ?? 'USA'; // country: 'England'
```

This is particularly useful for adding default values, for say, a class, if those things are not passed into the constructor:

```javascript
class myClass {
    constructor(name, options, items) {
        this.name = name ?? 'default name';
        this.options = options ?? {};
        this.items = items ?? [];
    }
}
```

## Optional chaining !!!

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining)

Optional chaining is useful when trying to get nested items inside an object, without having to validate your way through it. For example, we have an object `person` that may or may not have an `address.country` property

```javascript
const person = {
    name: 'John Smith',
    age: 46,
}; // no address property

console.log(person.address.country);
// TypeError Cannot read property 'country' of undefined
```

If we try and access `address.country` then JavaScript will error because we will be trying to access `country` on something that doesn't exist. We can get around this by first checking if `address` exists, if so, access it's `country` property.

```javascript
if (person.address) {
    console.log(person.address.country);
}
```

However, when an object gets more complicated, and the property you want to access may be multiple levels deep, you could easily get tangled in a mess of checking whether each level exists before accessing it. Optional chaining alliviates this by only accessing the next level if it exists, otherwise, it will return `undefined`, the syntax is simply a question mark before the dot syntax: `?.`
Using our example from above

```javascript
const person = {
    name: 'John Smith',
    age: 46,
}; // no address property

console.log(person.address?.country);
// undefined
```

This works for properties even if they are functions

```javascript
person.actions.sayHello();
// undefined
```

## Increased standardization of `for-in` enumeration order

This is less of a feature and more of a standardization between the various JS engines and their implementation of `for-in` loops due to the lack of specification from ECMA-262. The various engines have now agreed on a standard way of how properties are iterated.

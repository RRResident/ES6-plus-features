# ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) + Features

## Intro

This is a guide I have wrote for myself (and for anyone else) that goes over every new feature of JS starting from ECMAScript2015. This has allowed me to get a good understanding of powerful new features in JS and acts as a guide I can refer to.

The more notable features are marked with a `!!!` to be easily searchable. I went with three `!` as to not be confused with JS's 'bang bang' operator ðŸ”«.

Released ECMAScript iterations are divided into separate files
You can find them here:

1. [ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)](./ES6.md)
1. [ECMAScript 2016 (ES7)](./ES7.md)
1. [ECMAScript 2017 (ES8)](./ES8.md)
1. [ECMAScript 2018 (ES9)](./ES9.md)
1. [ECMAScript 2019 (ES10)](./ES10.md)
1. [ECMAScript 2020 (ES11)](./ES11.md)

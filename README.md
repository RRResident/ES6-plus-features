# ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) + Features

## Intro

This is a guide I have wrote for myself (and for anyone else) that introduces features of the various ECMAScript versions since ECMAScript 2015, with some useful links and examples. The more notable features are marked with a `!!` to be easily searchable.

Iterations are divided into separate files
You can find them here:

1. [ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)](./ES6.md)
1. [ECMAScript 2016 (ES7)](./ES7.md)
1. [ECMAScript 2017 (ES8)](./ES8.md)
1. [ECMAScript 2018 (ES9)](./ES9.md)
1. [ECMAScript 2019 (ES10)](./ES10.md)
1. [ECMAScript 2020 (ES11)](./ES11.md)
